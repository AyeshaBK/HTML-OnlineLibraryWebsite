					<h3>Review</h3>

						<b>
						Sparks are igniting.<br/>
						Flames are spreading.<br/>
						And the Capitol wants revenge.<br/>
						</b>
						<br/>
						Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow 
						District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive.
						Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned 
						to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way 
						Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta
						has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a 
						rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta 
						may have helped create.<br/>
						<br/>
						Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she 
						cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely
						convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta 
						to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the 
						stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow 
						of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the 
						consequences will be horrifying.
