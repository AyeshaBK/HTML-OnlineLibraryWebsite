					<h3>Review</h3>
					<br/>
					<p>
						It's been months since the ghost of Anna Korlov opened a door to 
						Hell in her basement and disappeared into it, but ghost-hunter Cas
						Lowood can't move on.<br/>
						His friends remind him that Anna sacrificed herself so that Cas 
						could live &minus; not walk around half dead. He knows they're right, but 
						in Cas's eyes, no living girl he meets can compare to the dead girl 
						he fell in love with.<br/>
						<br/>
						Now he's seeing Anna everywhere: sometimes when he's asleep and 
						sometimes in waking nightmares. But something is very wrong...
						these aren't just daydreams. Anna seems tortured, torn apart in new and 
						ever more gruesome ways every time she appears.
						Cas doesn't know what happened to Anna when she disappeared into Hell, 
						but he knows she doesn't deserve whatever is happening to her now. <br/>
						<br/>
						Anna saved Cas more than once, and it's time for him to return the favor.
