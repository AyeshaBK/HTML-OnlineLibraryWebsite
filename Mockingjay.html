							My name is Katniss Everdeen.<br/>
							Why am I not dead?<br/>
							I should be dead.<br/>
						</b>
						<br/>
						Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home 
						has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe.
						Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does 
						exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is 
						unfolding.<br/>
						<br/>
						It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the 
						cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has 
						long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has
						come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. 
						Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--
						except Katniss.<br/>
						<br/>
						The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be
						a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change
						the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside
						her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels'
						Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.
