					<h3>Review</h3>
					<br/>
					<p>
						Percy Jackson is a good kid, but he can't seem to focus on his 
						schoolwork or control his temper. And lately, being away at boarding
						school is only getting worse&minus;Percy could have sworn his pre&minus;algebra
						teacher turned into a monster and tried to kill him. When Percy's 
						mom finds out, she knows it's time that he knew the truth about 
						where he came from, and that he go to the one place he'll be safe.<br/>
						<br/>
						She sends Percy to Camp Half Blood, a summer camp for demigods 
						(on Long Island), where he learns that the father he never knew is 
						Poseidon, God of the Sea. Soon a mystery unfolds and together with
						his friends&minus;one a satyr and the other the demigod daughter of 
						Athena&minus;Percy sets out on a quest across the United States to reach 
						the gates of the Underworld (located in a recording studio in 
						Hollywood) and prevent a catastrophic war between the gods.
