						"BELLA?"<br/>
						<br/>
						Edward's soft voice came from behind me. I turned to see him spring 
						lightly up the porch steps, his hair windblown from running. He 
						pulled me into his arms at once, just like he had in the parking 
						lot, and kissed me again.<br/>
						<br/>
						This kiss frightened me. There was too much tension, too strong an 
						edge to the way his lips crushed mine - like he was afraid we had 
						only so much time left to us.
						<br/>

						<br/>
						As Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a
						malicious vampire continues her quest for revenge, Bella once again 
						finds herself surrounded by danger. In the midst of it all, she is 
						forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship 
						with Jacob - knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite 
						the ageless struggle between vampire and werewolf. With her 
						graduation quickly approaching, Bella has one more decision to make:
						life or death. But which is which?
