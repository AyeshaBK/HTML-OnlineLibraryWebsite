					<h3>Review</h3>
					<br/>
					<p>
						When you loved the one who was killing you, it left you no options.
						How could you run, how could you fight, when doing so would hurt 
						that beloved one? If your life was all you had to give, how could 
						you not give it? If it was someone you truly loved?<br/>
						--
						<br/>
						To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and 
						nightmare woven into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella
						Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward 
						Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob 
						Black, she has endured a tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and 
						strife to reach the ultimate turning point. Her imminent choice to 
						either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or to pursue 
						a fully human life has become the thread from which the fates of 
						two tribes hangs.<br/>
						<br/>
						Now that Bella has made her decision, a startling chain of 
						unprecedented events is about to unfold with potentially 
						devastating and unfathomable, consequences. Just when the frayed
						strands of Bella's life - first discovered in Twilight, then
						scattered and torn in New Moon and Eclipse - seem ready to heal and 
						knit together, could they be destroyed... forever?
