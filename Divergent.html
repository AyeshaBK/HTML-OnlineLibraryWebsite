					<h3>Review</h3>
					<br/>
					<p>
						In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided 
						into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a 
						particular virtue&minus;Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless),
						Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite 
						(the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all 
						sixteen&minus;year&minus;olds must select the faction to which they will devote
						the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between 
						staying with her family and being who she really is&minus;she can't have
						both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including 
						herself.<br/>
						<br/>
						During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice 
						renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates 
						to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo 
						extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological
						simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation 
						transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really
						are&minus;and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating,
						sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. 
						But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone
						because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers 
						unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly 
						perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save
						those she loves <br/>. . . or it might destroy her.
