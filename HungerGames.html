					<h3>Review</h3>
					<br/>
					<p>
						The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, 
						is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by
						12 poorer districts. Early in its history, a rebellion led by a 
						13th district against the Capitol resulted in its destruction and 
						the creation of an annual televised event known as <b>The Hunger Games.</b>
						<br/><br/>
						In punishment, and as a reminder of the power and grace of the Capitol,
						each district must yield one boy and one girl between the ages of 
						12 and 18 through a lottery system to participate in the games. 
						The 'tributes' are chosen during the annual Reaping and are forced 
						to fight to the death, leaving only one survivor to claim victory.<br/>
						<br/>
						When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as 
						District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her
						place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger
						, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their
						whole lives. , she sees it as a death sentence.<br/> But Katniss has been
						close to death before. For her, survival is second nature.
